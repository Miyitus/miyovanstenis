<br>
<br>The small Drone prototype presented in this project represents 
<br>the first level of security of this project. The Drone Cheerson CX-10 
<br>is intervened and inside contains an encrypted SD cart memory 
<br>with a collection of works, information, images,
<br>indeed, data that can compromise me political and legal as Venezuelan laws 
<br>describe any action against the government can be translated to an act 
<br>of “terrorism” or “treason”; but outside of his range of power not only 
<br>I can protect my work and content but also show what as artist
<br>I think is correct and share information.

<br>"The venezuelan artist Miyo Van Stenis, with her work VIGIPIRATE2.0 (prototype), 
<br>attacks the new political restrictions introduced in her country by Hugo Chavez in 2012. 
<br>Vigipirate is an anti-terrorism system based on various levels of security. The artist works
<br>on the second level, "raise vigilance", introducing data, informations and pictures in an
<br>Encrypted SD Card memory that could compromise this level according to the present norm applied in her country. This action could lead the artist to be accused of terrorism. The little drone Cheerson CX-10, which holds the encrypted sd card, becomes an epitome of freedom. 
<br>This work is part of a series of projects, such as <a href="http://miyovanstenis.com/blog/the-revolution-is-printing-all-over-me/">"The Revolution is printed all over me" </a><br>(2014 -ongoing) and <a href="http://dismantlingthesimulation.com/">"La Meta es Desmontar la Simulacion" (2014- on going)</a>, that aim to <br>
expose and attack the injustice and the repressions of the present venezuelan government". Kamilia Kard
