This applet can deform any GIF or JPG image.
Remember that are needed both Deform.class and Deformb.class.
This applet is fully parametrized, so you can generate all kinds of warpers
you want. Here an example of what you have to write in the html (the
things anfter the ; are comments with min-max values acceptet):

<applet code="Deform.class" width=150 height=132> ; Initial classtag
<param name=image value="imfad1.gif">   ; Image to load
<param name=res value="1">              ; resolution (1 .. 8)
<param name=distval value="130">        ; Distortion value (0 .. 500)
<param name=dfact value="35">           ; Distort factor (1 .. 100)
<param name=dspeed value="3">           ; Speed (1 .. 50)
<param name=doffset value="146">        ; X mixing offset (0 .. width)
<param name=xv1 value="10">             ; X1 offset (1 .. 19)
<param name=yv1 value="12">             ; Y1 offset (1 .. 19)
<param name=xv2 value="15">             ; X2 offset (1 .. 19)
<param name=yv2 value="18">             ; Y2 offset (1 .. 19)
Sorry, your browser doesn't suppor Java.  ; Msg in no java browsers
</applet>

Here detailed instructions:

The GIF/JPG image can be of any size. If res=1, remember to place the exact
size of image in "width" and "height" tags. If res=2, place double values,
if res=3 triple values etc.
In fact, res is a sort of zoomer.

The "distval" parameter (0 .. 500) changes the kind of waves: smaller
values will create many small waves, higher values will create less bigger
waves.

The "dfact" parameter (1 .. 100) controls the distortion factor.
Smaller values causes higher distortions, higher values less distortion.

The "dspeed" parameter (1 .. 50) determine the speed of waves.

The "doffset" parameter is not easy to explain. Aniway place values in the
range 0 .. width of the image. Best results with values near the width of
the image.

With xv1,yv1,xv2,yv2 (1 .. 19) you can control the offset between the two
radial waves that mixing each other generate the distortion.

the author of the applet, I placed a secret window that will appear if the
applet is clicked with mouse: it is external to the web browser, so it will
not hit the design of your beautyful html page. This small window will
simply show my name and ask for a link to my java applets page.. the user
can connect to it or cancel, or hide the window and connect after visiting
all your pages. I hope this credit part is not a problem for you...
Consider you will use an effect programmed by me, without pay anything!
